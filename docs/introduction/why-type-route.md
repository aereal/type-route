title: Why Type Route?
---

## Type Safe

Type Route's first and foremost concern is excellent TypeScript support. Existing routing libraries (even those written in TypeScript) lack APIs that are fully statically analyzable. Type Route's API was designed to fully leverage TypeScript's type inference powers. This means:

- Almost no type annotations are needed for 100% type safe code.
- Helpful completions and errors are surfaced in your code editor as you type.
- For editors which use TypeScript to power their JavaScript experience (such as VSCode) most of those editor smarts will carry over to your JavaScript editing experience as well.

## Flexible

Type Route was designed with excellent React integration in mind
but isn't coupled to a specific UI framework. Use it with
[React](../guides/react.md), [Angular](../guides/angular.md),
[Vue](../guides/vue.md) or anything else. There's even support for
non-browser environments such as React Native.

## Solid Foundation

The same [core
library](https://github.com/ReactTraining/history) behind React
Router also powers Type Route. From this solid foundation Type
Route adds a simple and flexible API optimized for a developer
experience that is second to none.
